#### We are going to write CSS for the HTML code :

**PART A (Selectors)**
- Give the h1 header a unique id - “mainTopic” & set its color to blue using the id selector.
- Align all the text in the page to the center using a universal selector.
- Change the font style of all heading tags in the page to ‘Georgia’.
- Set the color of all the paragraphs to white & background color to cornflowerblue. (Without using the element selector - ‘p’)
- Select all buttons inside div and change their background color to purple & text color to azure.

**PART B (Pseudo class & elements)**
- Change the button background color to yellow & text color to blue when we hover over it.
- Change the color of every odd numbered paragraph to yellow. (Paragraph 1 & 3)
- Change the color of the first letter of h1 heading to red.
- Set the text color of the checkbox label to dark green when the checkbox is ticked.
- Order these rules according to their specificity, from least specific to most specific :- h1, #mainContent, .main, div .main
