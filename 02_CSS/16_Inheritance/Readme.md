## Inheritance
In CSS, inheritance controls what happens when no value is specified for a property on an element.

CSS properties can be categorized in two types:-
- **Inherited Properties,** which by default are set to the computed value of the parent element.
- **Non-Inherited Properties,** which by default are set to initial value of the property.

### Inherited Properties
When no value for an inherited property has been specified on an element, the element gets the computed value of that property on its parent element. Only the root element of the document gets the initial value given in the property's summary.

### Non-Inherited Properties
When no value for a non-inherited property has been specified on an element, the element gets the initial value of that property (as specified in the property's summary).
