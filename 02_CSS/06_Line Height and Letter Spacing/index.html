    <h1>Cat Burglar Nami</h1>
    <p>Nami is one of the main characters in the popular anime and manga series One Piece by Eiichiro Oda. She is the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates and is known for her intelligence, resourcefulness, and ambition. Nami is clever, pragmatic, and sometimes a little manipulative, especially when it comes to money. However, she deeply cares for her crew and values their camaraderie. Nami grew up in Cocoyasi Village with her adoptive sister, Nojiko, and adoptive mother, Bellemere. Her tragic past involves the Arlong Pirates, who oppressed her village and forced her to work as a cartographer to buy back her village's freedom. Her liberation by Luffy and the crew marked her official joining of the Straw Hat Pirates. Nami plays a vital role as the crew's navigator, guiding them through the dangerous seas. She often takes charge of managing their finances, earning her the nickname "Cat Burglar" due to her love for treasure and money.</p>
