### Font-size units in CSS
There are two types of units: 

**Absolute -** means fixed that cannot be changed.
- px, pt, pc, cm, mm, in, etc...
- px means Pixel, used most of the time.
- 96 px = 1 inch
- not suitable for responsive websites.
**Relative -** it depends on another parameters and can be changed.
- %, em, rem, ch, vh, vw and many more...
- %, em and rem are used most of the time.
- em is a unit relative to the font size of the parent element.
- rem (root em) is a unit relative to the font size of the root element(<html> element).
