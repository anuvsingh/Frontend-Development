            <h3>Clow Council</h3>
            <p>
                The Clow Council is the elite feline division of The Whisker Syndicate, tasked with maintaining order in their secretive world. Led by the cunning and fearless tabby, Shadowclaw, the team includes Whisker, the tech-savvy Siamese, and Ember, the agile Bengal known for her swift moves. Their mission: to outsmart and capture the rogue Mouseketeer Trio, who have stolen vital Syndicate blueprints. With razor-sharp instincts and unmatched strategy, the cats use stealth and precision to track the mice. For Shadowclaw and her team, failure is not an option—the reputation of the Syndicate and the balance of power are at stake.

For them, freedom for mice everywhere depends on their ability to stay one step ahead.
