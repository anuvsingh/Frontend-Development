## Does JS have Classes ?
- Yes, JavaScript has classes
- But they are just a more structured way of implementing prototype-based inheritance.
- Under the hood, JavaScript still follows its prototypal inheritance model.

## OOPs in JS
- JavaScript supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- But it is prototype-based rather than class-based like Java or C++.
- With the introduction of ES6 classes, JavaScript provides a more structured way to implement OOP principles.
- You can implement Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction using ES6 classes or prototypes.

## 4 Pillars of OOPs
- Encapsulation *(Data Hiding)*
- Abstraction *(Hiding Complexity)*
- Inheritance *(Reusing Code)*
- Polymorphism *(Overriding Methods)*

## Why use OOPs in JS
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript brings structure, reusability, and scalability to code.
- While JavaScript can be used functionally
- OOP makes complex applications easier to manage by organizing code into objects that interact with each other.

## Objects in JS
- Collection of properties and methods

## Parts of OOPs
- Object literal
- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)
