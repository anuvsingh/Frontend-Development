### JS Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on conditions. If the condition is met, a particular block of code will run; otherwise, another block of code will execute based on the condition.

- **if statement-** Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **else statement-** Executes a block of code if the same condition of the preceding if statement is false.
- **else if statement-** Adds more conditions to the if statement, allowing for multiple alternative conditions to be tested.
- **switch statement-** Evaluates an expression, then executes the case statement that matches the expressionâ€™s value.
- **ternary operator-** Provides a concise way to write if-else statements in a single line.
- **nested if else statement-** Allows for multiple conditions to be checked in a hierarchical manner.
